Here's a `README.md` file for the Dirty Pipe vulnerability, including an explanation of the custom script:

# Dirty Pipe Vulnerability Detection Script

## Overview

This script helps detect if your system is vulnerable to the Dirty Pipe vulnerability (CVE-2022-0847), which affects Linux kernels starting from version 5.8.

## How It Works

1. **Command Check**: 
   - The script first checks if the `uname` command is available on your system. This command is essential for retrieving the kernel version.

   ```bash
   command_exists() {
       command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
   }
   ```

   - If `uname` is not available, the script will prompt you to ensure necessary tools are installed and will exit.

   ```bash
   if ! command_exists uname; then
       echo "'uname' command not found. Please ensure you have the necessary tools installed."
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Kernel Version Retrieval**: 
   - The script uses the `uname` command to get the current kernel version, stripping out additional information after the dash (`-`).

   ```bash
   kernel_version=$(uname -r | cut -d '-' -f 1)
   echo "Installed kernel version: $kernel_version"
   ```

3. **Version Comparison**: 
   - A function is defined to compare two version strings, handling cases where version numbers have different lengths by filling with zeros.

   ```bash
   version_compare() {
       if [ "$1" = "$2" ]; then
           return 0
       fi

       local IFS=.
       local i version1=($1) version2=($2)

       # Fill empty fields in version1 with zeros
       for ((i=${#version1[@]}; i<${#version2[@]}; i++)); do
           version1[i]=0
       done

       # Fill empty fields in version2 with zeros
       for ((i=${#version2[@]}; i<${#version1[@]}; i++)); do
           version2[i]=0
       done

       for ((i=0; i<${#version1[@]}; i++)); do
           if [ "${version1[i]}" -lt "${version2[i]}" ]; then
               return 1
           elif [ "${version1[i]}" -gt "${version2[i]}" ]; then
               return 2
           fi
       done

       return 0
   }
   ```

4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: 
   - The script checks if the installed kernel version is vulnerable by comparing it against version 5.8.

   ```bash
   vulnerable_version="5.8"

   version_compare "$kernel_version" "$vulnerable_version"
   vulnerable=$?

   if [ $vulnerable -eq 2 ]; then
       echo "Your system may be vulnerable to Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847). Consider upgrading your kernel."
       echo "Visit your Linux distribution's website for instructions on updating your kernel."
   else
       echo "Your system is not vulnerable to Dirty Pipe (CVE-2022-0847)."
   fi
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your terminal.
2. **Interpret Results**: Based on the output, take appropriate actions to secure your system.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the script.
- Regularly update your system and kernel to protect against vulnerabilities.
